Chapter 2 - C Fundamentals:

Compiling steps:
  1. Preprocessing 
  2. Compiling
  3. Linking

Preprocessing - obeys commands that start with # (directives). Can add to and modify program.

Compiling - translates program into machine instructions (object code).

Linking - combines object code produced with additional code needed to yield complete executable.
          Additional code includes library functions.



Simple C program pseudocode

```
directives

int main(void){ 
    statements

}

````

directives - Editing commands that modify the program prior to compilation

Macro Definition - (#define) term for naming constants in file
#define is a preprocessing directive
ex: #define INCHES 12

Chapter 3 - Formatted Input/Output: 

Conversion Specifiers:
    %d - Displays a decimal integer in base 10
    %e - Displays floating-point number in exponential form
    %f - Displays ploating-point number in fixed decimal form
    %g - Displays floating-point number in either exponential form or fixed decimal form,
         depending on the numbers size. Useful for displaying numbers of unknown size.
        
Escape Sequences:
    \a - Alert(bell)
    \b - Backspace
    \n - Newline
    \t - Horizontal tab

Chapter 4 - Expressions

Operator Precedence:
    Highest: +  -  (unary)
             *  /     %
    Lowest:  +  -  (binary)

    operators on the same line have equal precedence.
    unary - does nothing, used to emphasize a numeric constant is positive

Type Conversion:    
    If v and e don't have the same type,
    then the value of e is converted to the type of v as the assignment takes place:

    int i;
    float f;
    i = 72.99f;
    f = 136;

    i is now 72 
    f is now 136.0 

Increment and Decrement Operators:
    prefix: ++i and --i
        * "pre-increment" yields i + 1 and as a side effect, increments i
        * same for pre-decrement
        ex: i = 1;
            print(++i); -> prints 2
            print(i);   -> prints 2
    postfix: i++ and i--
        * "post-increment" yields i first then increments i after.
        *  same for post-decrement
        ex: i = 1;
            print(i++); -> prints 1
            print(i);   -> prints 2

Chapter 6 - Loops

The "do" Statement:
    * do is a while statement whose controlling expression is tested 
    * after each execution of the loop body.

"for" Statement Idioms:
    Counting up from 0 to n—l:
        for (i = O; i < n; i++)
    Counting up from 1 to n:
        for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    Counting down from n—l to 0:
        for (i = n - 1; i >= O; i--)
    Counting down from n to 1:
        for (i = n; i > O; i--)
    Infinite loop:
        for (;;)


The "goto" Statement:
    * capable of jumping to any statement in a function that has a label
    * useful for exiting from switches and nested loops

    ex: for (d = 2; d < n; d++)
          if ( n % d == 0)
              goto done;
        
        done:
            if (d < n)
                printf("%d is divisible by %d\n", n, d);
            else
                printf("%d is prime\n", n);

The "null" Statement:
    * expressed as just ";" by itself on a line
    * good for writing loops whose bodies are empty
