Compiling steps:
  1. Preprocessing 
  2. Compiling
  3. Linking

Preprocessing - obeys commands that start with # (directives). Can add to and modify program.

Compiling - translates program into machine instructions (object code).

Linking - combines object code produced with additional code needed to yield complete executable.
          Additional code includes library functions.



Simple C program pseudocode

```
directives

int main(void){ 
    statements

}

````

directives - Editing commands that modify the program prior to compilation

Macro Definition - (#define) term for naming constants in file
#define is a preprocessing directive
ex: #define INCHES 12
